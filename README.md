What is .NET Core?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>The .NET Core platform is a new .NET stack that is optimized for open source development and agile delivery on NuGet. </p><p>.NET Core has two major components. It includes a small runtime that is built from the same codebase as the .NET Framework CLR. The .NET Core runtime includes the same GC and JIT (RyuJIT), but doesn’t include features like Application Domains or Code Access Security. The runtime is delivered via NuGet, as part of the ASP.NET Core package.</p><p>.NET Core also includes the base class libraries. These libraries are largely the same code as the .NET Framework class libraries, but have been factored (removal of dependencies) to enable to ship a smaller set of libraries. These libraries are shipped as <code>System.*</code> NuGet packages on NuGet.org.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26908049/what-is-net-core" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is .NET Core?

MSIL is independent of hardware and the operating system. Cross language relationships are possible since MSIL is the same for all .NET languages.

CTS supports two different kinds of types: </p><ol><li><strong>Value Types</strong>: Contain the values that need to be stored directly on the stack or allocated inline in a structure. They can be built-in (standard primitive types), user-defined (defined in source code) or enumerations (sets of enumerated values that are represented by labels but stored as a numeric type).</li><li><strong>Reference Types</strong>: Store a reference to the value‘s memory address and are allocated on the heap.

For .NET Core, this will add many of the existing APIs that have been requested.</li><li>.NET Standard 2.0 includes a compatibility shim for .NET Framework binaries, significantly increasing the set of libraries that you can reference from your .NET Standard libraries.</li><li>.NET Standard will replace Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) as the tooling story for building multi-platform .NET libraries.</li></ul></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.talkingdotnet.com/asp-net-core-interview-questions/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is .NET Standard?

All packages are now managed within <em>.csproj</em> file.</p><p>The <strong>.csproj</strong>&nbsp;file has been cleaned up and it also serves the role of packages.config(or package.json for Node devs). That means that’s where your packages and versions will be saved.</p><p>NuGet packages are the unit of reference and they can depend on other NuGet packages, but also they can depend on projects. And as before, projects can also depend on NuGet packages and other projects. That means that projects and NuGet packages are interchangeable.</p><p>With .NET Core, you can easily turn your projects into NuGet packages, with one click inside of the properties.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://codingblast.com/asp-net-core-interview-questions/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What about NuGet packages and packages.config?

Why to use of the IDisposable interface?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>The "primary" use of the <code>IDisposable</code> interface is to clean up unmanaged resources. Note the purpose of the Dispose pattern is to provide a mechanism to clean up both <em>managed</em> and <em>unmanaged</em> resources and when that occurs depends on how the Dispose method is being called. </p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/538060/proper-use-of-the-idisposable-interface" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Why to use of the IDisposable interface?

What does Common Language Specification (CLS) mean?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>The <strong>Common Language Specification (CLS)</strong> is a fundamental set of language features supported by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) of the .NET Framework. CLS is a part of the specifications of the .NET Framework. CLS was designed to support language constructs commonly used by developers and to produce verifiable code, which allows all CLS-compliant languages to ensure the type safety of code. CLS includes features common to many object-oriented programming languages. It forms a subset of the functionality of common type system (CTS) and has more rules than defined in CTS.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25318/common-language-specification-cls-net" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What does Common Language Specification (CLS) mean?

Explain the difference between Task and Thread in .NET</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><ul><li><p><strong>Thread</strong> represents an actual OS-level thread, with its own stack and kernel resources.  Thread allows the highest degree of control; you can Abort() or Suspend() or Resume() a thread, you can observe its state, and you can set thread-level properties like the stack size, apartment state, or culture. ThreadPool is a wrapper around a pool of threads maintained by the CLR.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Task class</strong> from the Task Parallel Library offers the best of both worlds. Like the ThreadPool, a task does not create its own OS thread. Instead, tasks are executed by a TaskScheduler; the default scheduler simply runs on the ThreadPool. Unlike the ThreadPool, Task also allows you to find out when it finishes, and (via the generic Task) to return a result. </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13429129/task-vs-thread-differences" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Explain the difference between Task and Thread in .NET Interview Questions Source To Answer">stackoverflow.com</a></span></span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div></div></div></div></div> <br><br></div><div data-v-5e9078c0="" class="unit"><div><h2>🔹 28. Explain the difference between “managed” and “unmanaged” code?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><ul><li><p><strong>Managed</strong> code is not compiled to machine code but to an intermediate language which is interpreted and executed by some service on a machine and is therefore operating within a (hopefully!) secure framework which handles dangerous things like memory and threads for you. It runs on the CLR (Common Language Runtime), which, among other things, offers services like garbage collection, run-time type checking, and reference checking. So, think of it as, "My code is <em>managed</em> by the CLR."</p></li><li><p><strong>Unmanaged code</strong> is compiled to machine code and therefore executed by the OS directly. It therefore has the ability to do damaging/powerful things Managed code does not. This is how everything used to work, so typically it's associated with old stuff like .dlls</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3563870/difference-between-managed-and-unmanaged" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Explain the difference between “managed” and “unmanaged” code?

What is JIT compiler?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>Before a computer can execute the source code, special programs called compilers must rewrite it into machine instructions, also known as object code. This process (commonly referred to simply as “compilation”) can be done explicitly or implicitly.</p><p>Implicit compilation is a two-step process:</p><ul><li>The first step is converting the source code to intermediate language (IL) by a language-specific compiler. </li><li>The second step is converting the IL to machine instructions.
